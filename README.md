Expressify is a capstone project developed as part of the Bangkit Academy program, bringing together the Mobile Development, Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning cohorts. Our aim with Expressify is to address two significant challenges people often face in their daily lives: finding music that suits their mood and having a platform to express their feelings when they lack someone to talk to.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### **Problem Statement**

<br>
Many individuals struggle with deciding what music to listen to that aligns with their current emotional state. They find it challenging to discover songs that truly resonate with their mood, resulting in an incomplete music experience.

Furthermore, there are moments when people yearn to express their feelings, thoughts, or experiences but lack a supportive individual to confide in. This absence of an empathetic ear can lead to emotional bottling, potentially impacting their mental well-being.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### **Solution: Enhancing Mental Well-being**

<br>

Expressify addresses these challenges by offering a comprehensive mobile application that combines key features to enhance users' mental well-being.

1. **Moodify**: Our Moodify feature utilizes cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to analyze users' facial expressions and predict their mood accurately. Based on the predicted mood, Expressify recommends personalized music, books, or movies that align with their emotional state. Users can now enjoy a more immersive and tailored music experience that resonates with their feelings.

2. **Journals**: Expressify provides a safe space for users to express their thoughts, emotions, and experiences through journaling. This feature not only acts as an outlet for self-expression but also utilizes machine learning techniques to provide valuable insights and analysis. Users receive feedback and suggestions on their mental well-being, helping them identify potential areas that may require professional support.

### **Conclusion**

Expressify is a unique mobile application that aims to enhance users' mental well-being through the power of technology. By leveraging machine learning, cloud computing, and mobile development, we have created an all-encompassing platform that addresses the challenges of finding suitable music and providing a supportive space for self-expression. Our collaborative efforts across multiple Bangkit Academy cohorts have enabled us to create a robust and innovative solution.

We believe Expressify has the potential to positively impact individuals' lives by providing personalized recommendations and a supportive environment for emotional expression. We are excited to further develop and refine Expressify, ensuring that it becomes an invaluable tool for enhancing mental well-being.
